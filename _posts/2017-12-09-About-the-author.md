Hi there! I'm Biko, software developer at [Codeverse Technology](https://codeversetech.com"). I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career for more than ten years. The purpose of this blog is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for my thoughts,  expiriences, and mistakes with technology.

Check out my [Github profile here](https://github.com/bikobaingaru) for a compilation of some of open source projects I participate.
